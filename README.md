| zadanie4 = task4 |
+------------------+

The aim of the fourth task is to create a program that implements two methods of numerical integration: a complex Newton-Cotes quadrature based on three nodes 
(Simpson's formula) and integration over the interval [0,+∞) with weight e−x (Laguerre polynomials) of integrals of the form ∫+ ∞0e−xf(x)dx

-> Simpson's formula
-> Laguerre polynomials
